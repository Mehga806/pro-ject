        <p class="container text-dark">The Right Amount of Coffee Is Good for You ...
          Caffeine is the first thing that comes to mind when you think about coffee. But coffee also contains
          antioxidants and other active substances that may reduce internal inflammation and protect against disease,
          say nutrition experts from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. <br><br>
  
          The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are
          roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out,
          producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can
          be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed
          canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or
          enhance the flavor.<br><br>
  
          Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the
          Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day
          Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first
          roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.[3] The coffee beans were
          procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, and cultivated in
          Yemen. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later
          spreading to Europe.<br><br>
  
          The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta.[4] Coffee plants are cultivated
          in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian
          subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the
          world's total. Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an agricultural commodity. Despite sales of coffee
          reaching billions of dollars worldwide, farmers producing coffee beans disproportionately live in poverty.
          Critics of the coffee industry have also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing
          of land for coffee-growing and water use. <br><br></p>

              <p class="container text-dark"> The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee
                tree appears
                in the middle of
                the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen,[3] where coffee seeds were first roasted
                and
                brewed in a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their
                religious rituals.[12] Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee plant before its appearance in Yemen.
                From Ethiopia, coffee could have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea.[13] One account
                credits Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast,[14] other early
                accounts
                say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia.[14][15] According
                to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's
                companions in 1401.<br><br>
  
                Famous 16th-century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings that a beverage called
                qahwa
                developed from a tree in the Zeila region located in the Horn of Africa.[12] Coffee was first exported
                from
                Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera and Zeila in modern-day Somaliland, which was procured
                from Harar and the Abyssinian interior. According to Captain Haines, who was the colonial administrator of
                Aden (1839 to 1854), Mocha historically imported up to two-thirds of their coffee from Berbera-based
                merchants
                before the coffee trade of Mocha was captured by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. After that,
                much of the Ethiopian coffee was exported to Aden via Berbera By the 16th century, coffee had reached the
                rest of the Middle East and North Africa.[17] The first coffee seeds were smuggled out of the Middle East
                by
                Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to India during the time. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or
                otherwise sterilized. Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by
                strapping
                them to his chest. The first plants from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore.
  
                Coffee had spread to Italy by 1600 and then to the rest of Europe, Indonesia, and the Americas.[18][better
                source needed]
  
                In 1583, Leonhard Rauwolf, a German physician, gave this description of coffee after returning from a
                ten-year trip to the Near East:
  
                A beverage as black as ink, useful against numerous illnesses, particularly those of the stomach. Its
                consumers take it in the morning, quite frankly, in a porcelain cup passed around and from which each one
                drinks a cupful. It is composed of water and the fruit from a bush called bunnu.
  
                Léonard Rauwolf, Reise in die Morgenländer (in German)
                The thriving trade between Venice and North Africa and the Middle East (back then Ottoman Empire) brought
                many goods, including coffee, to the Venetian port. From Venice, it was introduced to the rest of Europe.
                Coffee became more widely accepted after it was deemed a Christian beverage by Pope Clement VIII in 1600,
                despite appeals to ban the "Muslim drink". The first European coffee house opened in Venice in 1647.[19]
